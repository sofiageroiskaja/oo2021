List interface in Java is a sub-interface of the Java 
collections interface. It contains the index-based 
methods to insert, update, delete, and search the 
elements. It can have duplicate elements also. We can 
also store the null elements in the list. List preserves the 
insertion order, it allows positional access and 
insertion of elements. 

The Set follows the unordered way and it found in 
java.util package and extends the collection interface 
in java. Duplicate item will be ignored in Set and it 
will not print in the final output.

The Java Map interface, java.util.Map represents a 
mapping between a key and a value. More specifically, 
a Java Map can store pairs of keys and values. Each key 
is linked to a specific value. Once stored in a Map, you 
can later look up the value using just the key. 

DIFFERENCE
The list interface allows duplicate elements
Set does not allow duplicate elements.
The map does not allow duplicate elements

The list maintains insertion order.
Set do not maintain any insertion order. 
The map also does not maintain any insertion order. 

We can add any number of null values.
But in set almost only one null value.
The map allows a single null key at most and any number 
of null values.

The list provides get() method to get the element at a specified index.
Set does not provide get method to get the elements at a specified index
The map does not  provide get method to get the elements at a specified index

If you need to access the elements frequently by using the index then we can use the list
If you want to create a collection of unique elements then we can use set
If you want to store the data in the form of key/value pair then we can use the map.
